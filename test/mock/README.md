## Mocks for Perseo

Mocks are simulated requests that mimic the behavior of real requests in controlled ways.
This mock is used to simulate a behaviour of email client (smtp), sms client (smpp), an update context to Context Broker and send by API REST the content received (http)

#### Usage:

```

    *        -sp: change smtp port (by default is 9999).                                    *
    *        -hp: change http port (by default is 9998).                                    *
    *        --i: show more info in console (by default is False).                          *

```

```
    config.sms = {
        URL : 'http://<mock host>:<http port>/send/sms',
        API_KEY : '',
        API_SECRET: '',
        from: ''
