Feature: Launch an action if a visual rule is triggered in Perseo manager
  As a Perseo user
  I want to be able to launch a action (sms, email or update) if a visual rule is triggered in Perseo manager
  so that they become more functional and useful

  Background:
    Given perseo-fe is up and running


  @happy_path @value_threshold_card
  Scenario Outline: Launch an action if a visual rule is triggered in Perseo manager using only value threshold card and an action card
    # create a new visual rule
    Given create a sensor card of value threshold type, with id "card_4", attribute name "temperature", operator "<condition>", data type "Quantity", parameter value "<attribute_value>" and connect to "card_5"
    And create a sms action card with id "card_5" text "The new value is ${temperature}" telephone number "666999666" and connected to ""
    And append a new rule name "value_threshold", activate "1"
    # notifications
    And a notifications with subscription_id "aaaaa" and originator "localhost"
    And add to the notification an entity with id "room" and type "Room" with the following attributes
      | attribute_id | attribute_type | attribute_new_value  |
      | temperature  | celcius        | <notification_value> |
    When the notification is sent to perseo
    Then the mock receive the number "1" of actions "sms"
    And the mock receive this part of text "The new value is" in the action "sms"

  Examples:
    | condition    | attribute_value | notification_value |
    | GREATER_THAN | 3400            | 3401               |
    | MINOR_THAN   | 240             | 239                |
    | EQUAL_TO     | 300             | 300                |

  @attribute_threshold_card
  Scenario Outline: launch a action if a visual rule is triggered in Perseo manager using only attribute threshold card and actions cards
    # create a new visual rule
    Given create a sensor card of attribute threshold type, with id "card_5", attribute name "temperature", operator "<condition>", data type "Quantity", attribute to refer "temperature_value" and connect to "card_6"
    And create a sms action card with id "card_6" text "The attribute_value is ${temperature} and the attribute_threshold value is ${temperature_value}" telephone number "666999666" and connected to ""
    And append a new rule name "attribute_threshold", activate "1"
    # notifications
    And a notifications with subscription_id "aaaaa" and originator "localhost"
    And add to the notification an entity with id "room" and type "Room" with the following attributes
      | attribute_id      | attribute_type | attribute_new_value                  |
      | temperature       | celcius        | <attribute_value>                    |
      | temperature_value | celcius        | <notification_refer_attribute_value> |
    When the notification is sent to perseo
    Then the mock receive the number "1" of actions "sms"
    And the mock receive this part of text "The attribute_value is <attribute_value> and the attribute_threshold value is <notification_refer_attribute_value>" in the action "sms"

  Examples:
    | condition    | attribute_value | notification_refer_attribute_value |
    | GREATER_THAN | 3401            | 3400                               |
    | MINOR_THAN   | 239             | 240                                |
    | EQUAL_TO     | 300             | 300                                |

  @type_card
  Scenario Outline: launch a action if a visual rule is triggered in Perseo manager using only type card and actions cards
    # create a new visual rule
    Given create a sensor card of type type, with "card_3", identity type "Room",operator "<condition>" and connect to "card_4"
    And create a sms action card with id "card_4" text "The new temperature is ${temperature}" telephone number "666999666" and connected to ""
    And append a new rule name "type", activate "1"
    # notifications
    And a notifications with subscription_id "aaaaa" and originator "localhost"
    And add to the notification an entity with id "room" and type "<entity_type>" with the following attributes
      | attribute_id | attribute_type | attribute_new_value |
      | temperature  | celcius        | 300                 |
    When the notification is sent to perseo
    Then the mock receive the number "1" of actions "sms"
    And the mock receive this part of text "The new temperature is 300" in the action "sms"

  Examples:
    | entity_type | condition    |
    | Room        | EQUAL_TO     |
    | NoRoom      | DIFFERENT_TO |

  @id_card
  Scenario Outline: launch a action if a visual rule is triggered in Perseo manager using only id-regexp card and actions cards
