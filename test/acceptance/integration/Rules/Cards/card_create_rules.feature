Feature: Append a new rule in Perseo manager using cards from portal
  As a Perseo user
  I want to be able to append a new rule in Perseo manager using cards from portal
  so that they become more functional and useful

  @happy_path
  Scenario: append a new rule in Perseo manager using card from portal with all cards
     # Sensor cards
    #Given create a sensor card of notUpdated type with id "card_1", verify interval "45", attribute name "temperature", max time without update "10" and connect to "card_2"
    And create a sensor card of id type, with id "card_2", identity id "room2" and connect to "card_3"
    And create a sensor card of type type, with "card_3", identity type "room",operator "DIFFERENT_TO" and connect to "card_4"
    And create a sensor card of value threshold type, with id "card_4", attribute name "temperature", operator "GREATER_THAN", data type "Quantity", parameter value "34" and connect to "card_5"
    And create a sensor card of attribute threshold type, with id "card_5", attribute name "temperature", operator "GREATER_THAN", data type "Quantity", attribute to refer "temperature_refer" and connect to "card_6"
    And create a sensor card of epl type with id "card_6", epl query "sdfsdfsd dfsdfsdf sdfsdfsdf" and connect to "card_7"
     # Action cards
    And create a action card of "SendEmailAction" type, with id "card_7", response "${device_latitude}${device_longitude}${measure.value}", parameters "erwer@sdfsf.com" and connect to "card_8"
    And create a action card of "SendSmsMibAction" type, with id "card_8", response "${device_latitude}${device_longitude}${measure.value}", parameters "123456789" and connect to "card_9"
    And create a action card of "updateAttribute" type, with id "card_9", response "DANGER", parameters "ALARM" and connect to "card_10"
     # Time cards
    And create a time card of time elapsed type, with id "card_10", interval "8" and connect to "card_11"
     # end cards
    When append a new rule name "test_000001", activate "1"

  Scenario Outline: append a new rule in Perseo manager using card from portal using value threshold, id, type cards and actions cards
    Given create a sensor card of value threshold type, with id "card_4", attribute name "temperature", operator "GREATER_THAN", data type "Quantity", parameter value "34" and connect to "card_5"
    And create a sensor card of id type, with id "card_2", identity id "room2" and connect to "card_3"
    And create a sensor card of type type, with "card_3", identity type "room",operator "DIFFERENT_TO" and connect to "card_4"
    And create a action card of "<action>" type, with id "card_7", response "<response>", parameters "<parameters>" and connect to "card_8"
    When append a new rule name "<rule_name>", activate "1"
    Then I receive an "201" http code in rules request
    And Validate that rule name is created successfully in db
  Examples:
    | rule_name   | action           | response                                              | parameters      |
