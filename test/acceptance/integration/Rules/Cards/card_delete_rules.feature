  Scenario: delete a rule in Perseo manager from portal with all cards
     # Sensor cards
    Given create a sensor card of notUpdated type with id "card_1", verify interval "45", attribute name "temperature", max time without update "10" and connect to "card_2"
    And create a sensor card of id type, with id "card_2", identity id "room2" and connect to "card_3"
    And create a sensor card of type type, with "card_3", identity type "room",operator "DIFFERENT_TO" and connect to "card_4"
    And create a sensor card of value threshold type, with id "card_4", attribute name "temperature", operator "GREATER_THAN", data type "Quantity", parameter value "34" and connect to "card_5"
    And create a sensor card of attribute threshold type, with id "card_5", attribute name "temperature", operator "GREATER_THAN", data type "Quantity", attribute to refer "temperature_refer" and connect to "card_6"
    And create a sensor card of epl type with id "card_6", epl query "sdfsdfsd dfsdfsdf sdfsdfsdf" and connect to "card_7"
     # Action cards
