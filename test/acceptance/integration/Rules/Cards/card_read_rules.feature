Feature: get rules in Perseo manager from portal
  As a Perseo user
  I want to be able to get rules in Perseo manager from portal
  so that they become more functional and useful

  @happy_path @value_threshold_card
  Scenario Outline: get a visual rule in Perseo manager using card from portal using only value threshold card and actions cards
    Given create a sensor card of value threshold type, with id "card_4", attribute name "<attribute_name>", operator "<operator>", data type "<data_type>", parameter value "<value>" and connect to "card_5"
    And create a action card of "<action>" type, with id "card_7", response "<response>", parameters "<parameters>" and connect to "card_8"
    And append a new rule name "<rule_name>", activate "1"
    When read a visual rule in perseo
    Then I receive an "200" http code in rules request
    And validate that all visual rules are returned
  Examples:
    | rule_name     | attribute_name | operator     | data_type | value | action           | response                                              | parameters      |
