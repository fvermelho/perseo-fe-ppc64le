Feature: Update a rule in Perseo manager using cards from portal
  As a Perseo user
  I want to be able to update a rule in Perseo manager using cards from portal
  so that they become more functional and useful

  @value_threshold_card_without_action_card
  Scenario: try to update a rule in Perseo manager using card from portal using only value threshold card without action card
    # create a new visual rule
    Given create a sensor card of value threshold type, with id "card_4", attribute name "temperature", operator "GREATER_THAN", data type "Quantity", parameter value "34" and connect to "card_5"
    And create a action card of "SendEmailAction" type, with id "card_7", response "${device_latitude}${device_longitude}${measure.value}", parameters "erwer@sdfsf.com" and connect to "card_8"
    And append a new rule name "test_10000000001", activate "1"
    # update the same visual rule without an action card
    And create a sensor card of value threshold type, with id "card_4", attribute name "temperature", operator "MINOR_THAN", data type "Quantity", parameter value "67" and connect to "card_5"
    When update a visual rule "test_10000000001"
    Then I receive an "400" http code in rules request

  @value_threshold_card
  Scenario Outline: update a rule created previously in Perseo manager using card from portal using only value threshold card and actions cards
    # create a new visual rule
    Given create a sensor card of value threshold type, with id "card_4", attribute name "<attribute_name>", operator "<operator>", data type "<data_type>", parameter value "<value>" and connect to "card_5"
    And create a action card of "<action>" type, with id "card_7", response "<response>", parameters "<parameters>" and connect to "card_8"
    And append a new rule name "<rule_name>", activate "1"
    # update the same visual rule with an action card
    And create a sensor card of value threshold type, with id "card_4", attribute name "<attribute_name>", operator "<operator>", data type "<data_type>", parameter value "345345" and connect to "card_5"
    And create a action card of "<action>" type, with id "card_7", response "<response>", parameters "<parameters>" and connect to "card_8"
    When update a visual rule "<rule_name>"
    Then I receive an "200" http code in rules request
    And Validate that rule name is created successfully in db
    And Check the parameter value of the sensor card "card_4" changed to "345345"

    And append a new rule name "test_31000000001", activate "1"
    # update the same visual rule without an action card
    And create a time card of time elapsed type, with id "card_10", interval "28" and connect to "card_11"
    When update a visual rule "test_31000000001"
    Then I receive an "400" http code in rules request

  @elapsed_card
  Scenario Outline: update a rule created previously in Perseo manager using card from portal using only elapsed card and action card
    # create a new visual rule
    Given create a time card of time elapsed type, with id "card_10", interval "<interval>" and connect to "card_11"
    And create a action card of "<action>" type, with id "card_7", response "<response>", parameters "<parameters>" and connect to "card_8"
    And append a new rule name "<rule_name>", activate "1"
    # update the same visual rule with an action card
    And create a time card of time elapsed type, with id "card_10", interval "45" and connect to "card_11"
    And create a action card of "<action>" type, with id "card_7", response "<response>", parameters "<parameters>" and connect to "card_8"
    When update a visual rule "<rule_name>"
    Then I receive an "200" http code in rules request
    And Validate that rule name is created successfully in db
    And Check the interval value of the sensor card "card_10" changed to "45"

  Examples:
    | rule_name        | interval | action           | response                    | parameters      |
    | test_41000000001 | 8        | SendEmailAction  | email body ${measure.value} | erwer@sdfsf.com |
    | test_41000000002 | -8       | SendSmsMibAction | sms body ${measure.value}   | 1234567890      |
    | test_41000000003 | 0        | updateAttribute  | DANGER                      | ALARM           |
