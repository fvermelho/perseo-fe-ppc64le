# PERSEO Acceptance Tests

Folder for acceptance tests of Perseo.

## How to Run the Acceptance Tests

### Prerequisites:

- Python 2.6 or newer
- pip installed (http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/)
- virtualenv installed (pip install virtualenv) (optional).
Note: We recommend the use of virtualenv, because is an isolated working copy of Python which allows you to work on a specific project without worry of affecting other projects.

##### Environment preparation:

- If you are going to use a virtual environment (optional):
  * Create a virtual environment somewhere, e.g. in ~/venv (virtualenv ~/venv) (optional)
  * Activate the virtual environment (source ~/venv/bin/activate) (optional)
- Both if you are using a virtual environment or not:
  * Change to the test/acceptance folder of the project.
  * Install the requirements for the acceptance tests in the virtual environment
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt --allow-all-external
     ```
  * Verify if  xmltodict, httplib2 and requests libraries are installed, if not are installed:
     ```
     pip install xmltodict httplib2 requests
     ```

##### Requeriments for mongoDB

-  pip install pymongo

### Use of mock
we recommend the use of mock for this acceptance test plan
```
  copy in local the mock folder (test/mock)
  execution:
     ./perseo_mock.py -u       --> show the usage or see README.md in test/mock
```

### Tests execution:

- Change to the test/acceptance folder of the project if not already on it.
- Rename properties.json.base to properties.json and replace values.
- Run lettuce_tools (see available params with the -h option).

```
Some examples:
   lettuce_tools                                   -- run all features
   lettuce_tools -ft ckan_row.feature              -- run only one feature
   lettuce_tools -tg test -ft ckan_row.feature     -- run scenarios tagged with "test" in a feature
   lettuce_tools -tg=-skip -ft ckan_row.feature    -- run all scenarios except tagged with "skip" in a feature
```

### Tests Coverage (features):

- epl_create_rules.
- epl_read_rules.
- epl_delete_rules.
- card_create_rules.
- card_read_rules.
- card_delete_rules.
- card_update_rules.
- notification_epl.
- notification_cards.

- mongoDB:
    * mongo_host: mongo host used by Perseo
    * mongo_port: mongo port used by Perseo
    * mongo_database: mongo database used by Perseo
    * mongo_collection: mongo collection to store the rules

- mongoOrion:
    * mongo_host: mongo host used by Mongo-Orion fake
    * mongo_port: mongo port used by Mongo-Orion fake
    * mongo_database: mongo database used by Mongo-Orion fake
    * mongo_collection: mongo collection to store the context in Mongo-Orion
     Note: These are used mainly to simulate a Context Broker Mongo with  "Not Updated" functionality.
         We create a context in this mongo where will be verified if an attribute is updated on a given interval.

### tags

You can to use multiples tags in each scenario, possibles tags used:

    - happy_path, skip, errors_40x, etc.
    - The "skip" tag is to skip the scenarios that still are not developed or failed
      always it is associated to an issue or bug.
            usage: -tg=-skip
    - the "only_develop" tag is used to verify releases that has not all funcionabilities. discards the scenarios tagged
            usage: -tg=-only_develop

and to filter scenarios by these tags: see Tests execution section.
